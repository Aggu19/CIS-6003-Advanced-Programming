The Online Vehicle Reservation System is a computerized application designed to streamline the cab booking process for Mega City Cab, a popular taxi service in Colombo. The current manual system is inefficient and prone to errors, necessitating an automated solution for handling customer bookings, managing driver assignments, and generating bills effectively.

This system incorporates features such as secure authentication, customer registration, booking management, billing calculations, and real-time vehicle availability updates. The application is developed using Java programming language and follows object-oriented design principles with proper implementation of UML diagrams, including Use Case, Class, and Sequence diagrams. It also integrates design patterns and a database-driven architecture to ensure efficiency and reliability.

Additionally, the system follows a test-driven development (TDD) approach, incorporating automated testing to validate functionality. Version control using GitHub ensures proper documentation and version tracking throughout the development lifecycle. The proposed system enhances service efficiency, reduces manual errors, and provides an improved user experience for both customers and administrators.
